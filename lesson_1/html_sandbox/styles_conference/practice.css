- `p` is a type selector because it's selecting all <p> elements
- Declarations for this are placed inside of curly braces
- A declaration begins with a property, and is followed by a value.

/* 

A selector that begins with a period as above with `.awesome` is a class
selector, and styles all elements belonging to this class.
- class is an attribute that can be assigned to a bunch of elements.
- Different elements can have the same class:

<div class="awesome">...</div>
<p class="awesome">...</div>

/*

ID selectors are even more specific than class selectors; they target individual
elements. written with `#` followed by the id selector value

<div id="clarkeparker">...</div>


-> I guess that means that elements can share the same class attribute value,
   but can't share the same id attribute value??? Yes.
-> apparently, if used, they should be reserved for significant elements.

/*

There are even more selectors than these!
These are the common ones, but selectors can get pretty darn powerful.
